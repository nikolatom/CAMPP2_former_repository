TCGA mRNA expression data in Primary Tumor and Normal Tissue samples
for Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA). The final epression file contain 1089 primary tumor samples 
and 112 normal tissue samples.

* REQUIREMENTS
- Packages (version used to produce this data):
	- TCGAbiolinks (2.12.5)
	- SummarizedExperiment (1.14.1)

* WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
Step 1. Get TCGA-BRCA mRNA expression data from GDC:
Collect female barcodes from the 'TCGAbiolinks' function 'GDCquery_clinic'
and get TCGA mRNA expression in primary tumor and normal samples from
GDC for those using TCGAbiolinks function 'GDCquery' with options:
	data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
        data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
        workflow.type = "HTSeq - Counts",
        sample.type = c("Primary solid Tumor",  "Solid Tissue Normal"),
        legacy = FALSE
	barcode = female_barcodes    
and then aggregating the results with 'GDCprepare' using 
directory = “../../GDCdata”.

Step 2. Preprocessing data in three steps:
	1. Data pre-processing, sorting out samples with a spearman correlation 
	coefficient less than 0.6, using function 'TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing' 
	with options:
		- cor.cut = 0.6
	2. Data withinLane GC-count normalization using the function 
	‘'TCGAanalyze_Normalization' with options:
		- geneInfo = geneInfoHT,
		- method = "gcContent"
	3. Data 0.25 quantile filtering with function 'TCGAanalyze_Filtering' 
	with options:
		- method = "quantile",
		- qnt.cut =  0.25
	Files form all steps are saved twice, one file with ensembl IDs as row names
	and the other with HUGO names as row names.  

* OUTPUT
1. data: This is a directory containing the aggregated data downloaded from GDC
in a SummarizedExperiment format.

2. BRCA_dataPrep.rda and BRCA_dataPrep_HUGO.rda: These files come from
the first pre-processing step and contain mRNA expression values, with TCGA 
barcodes as column names and gene ID as row names: ensembl IDs in 
BRCA_dataPrep.rda and HUGO names in BRCA_dataPrep_HUGO.rda 
(see Step 2.1 in ‘WHAT HAS BEEN DONE’)

3. BRCA_dataNorm.rda and BRCA_dataNorm_HUGO.rda: These files come
from the GC-count normalization step and contain mRNA expression values, with 
TCGA barcodes as column names and gene ID as row names: ensembl IDs 
in BRCA_dataNorm.rda and HUGO names in BRCA_dataNorm_HUGO.rda 
(see Step 2.2 in ‘WHAT HAS BEEN DONE’)

4. BRCA_dataFilt.rda and BRCA_dataFilt_HUGO.rda: These files come
from the quantile filtering step and contain mRNA expression values, with 
TCGA barcodes as column names and gene ID as row names: ensembl IDs 
in BRCA_dataFilt.rda and HUGO names in BRCA_dataNorm_HUGO.rda 
(see Step 2.3 in ‘WHAT HAS BEEN DONE’)

5. dataPrep_BRCA_array_array.png: Standard output plot form the first
pre-processing step. It visualizes intensity correlation, and samples by 
samples correlation.

* BUILDING THE DATABASE
There are two available R scripts: TCGA_expression.r and 
TCGA_expression_functions.r. The TCGA_expression.r is the script to
run, and it loads the functions found in TCGA_expression_functions.r

Run TCGA_expression.r on the terminal like:
“Rscript TCGA_expression.r [cancer]”

This exact line was used to produce the results found in this folder:
“Rscript TCGA_expression.r BRCA”
