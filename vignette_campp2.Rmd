abstract: 
  The CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline 2 (CAMPP2) is a R package designed to be
  submitted to Bioconductor. It is a tool for downstream analyses which is agnostic
  with respect to the source of -omics  biological data. It requires that data
  quantification has been carried out before using the data as inputs in the pipeline. 
  The pipeline is versatile and the functions or part of them can be used for analysis 
  of a variety of quantitative biological data from high throughput platforms, 
  including genes, proteins, small RNAs, lipids and glycans. 
  CAMPP2 currently supports; differential expression/abundance analysis, 
  LASSO/Elastic Net regression,Weighed Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, 
  Correlation analysis and Survival analysis (Cox proportional hazard regression).

# About CAMPP (TO BE EDITED)
The pipeline can perform the following types of analysis (|) Differential
expression/abundance analysis (limma [26]), (II) LASSO/Elastic-Net
regression (glmnet [12]), (III) Weighed Gene Co-expression Network
Analysis (WGCNA [23]), (IV) Correlation analysis (Pearson/Spearman),
(V) Survival analysis (Cox proportional hazard regression,
survcomp [29]) and (VI) protein-protein/gene-miRNA interaction
network analysis (multimiR [27] and the STRING [20]). In addition
to different types of analysis the pipeline performs missing value
imputation, normalization and transformation, along with data distributional
checks. Differential expression/abundance analysis can be
performed with as few as 3 biological replicates in each group, whereas
LASSO/Elastic-Net regression, WGCNA, correlation and survival
analysis is only advisable with a large(r) number of samples. CAMPP
may be run with a variety of biological molecules (genes, miRNAs,
proteins etc.) from various platforms (high-throughput sequencing,
microarray data, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, etc.). For
differential expression/abundance analysis the limma package [26] for
R is utilized. Though limma was originally designed for microarray
data, and more recently RNAseq, a number of studies have shown
the versatility of this software for the analysis of other -omics data
[4, 21, 24]. LIMMA has few underlying statistical assumptions and is
known to be powerful for small sample sizes as a result of shrinkage of
feature-specific variances [31].

N.B The user should be careful with LASSO/Elastic-Net regression, as this
type of analysis needs a good number of samples, in a balanced group
design, to yield reliable results. Recommended is a minium of 30 samples for
each group in the design [12][]. To perform WGCNA [23] at least 15 samples
must be available for analysis (section 5 in FAQ here: https://horvath.
genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html), see
description of WGCNA on page X.

Survival (over-all, relapse-free) of patients based on the abundance/expression
of a given marker is predicted using cox proportional-hazard
model. Check for proportional hazard and linearity of continuous
covariates are automatically performed. If the user wants to correct
for confounders, such as patient age at diagnosis, drug treatment, etc.,
these may be included in the model.

N.B For every parameter added to the model more events are needed for appropriate
statistical power. A rule of thumb is10 events for each parameter,
however, this will somewhat depend on the number of levels within a given
parameter. Generally results of the survival analysis should be interpreted
with caution as the pipeline is unable to account for all possible options and
assumptions related to this type of analysis.
The check for proportional hazard and linearity of continuous covariates
should be OK before interpreting any results!


# Requirements

To run CAMPP2, a working R version 4.0.0 (or newer) is required.

The Pipeline relies on a variety of R-packages which are installed
during CAMPP2 installation.

# Running CAMPP2

## Example data
The test data include 2 BRCA datasets (campp2_brca_1, campp2_brca_2) and associated metadata (campp2_brca_1_meta, campp2_brca_2_meta). Each dataset is represented by raw read counts for 25 samples (15 tumor, 10 normal samples in the 1st dataset; 18 tumors and 7 normal samples in the 2nd dataset). Metadata includes information about diagnosis, age, vital status, days to death, outcome time, tumor stage, outcome and survival.

Both, raw read counts and metadata were extracted from TCGA-BRCA Level 3. 

Test data are integrated into CAMPP2 package and accessible as campp2_brca_1, campp2_brca_2, campp2_brca_1_meta, campp2_brca_2_meta variables once the package is installed. R data object files (.rda) are also available on https://github.com/ELELAB/CAMPP2/tree/main/data. 

## Running example script

##Load CAMPP2 package:
```
library(CAMPP2)
```
##Test data are already part of the CAMPP2 package so user doesn't need to download them. In case you want to load .rda objects you can alter the path and use this code:
```
load("/path/to/campp2_brca_1.rda")
load("/path/to/campp2_brca_1_meta.rda")
load("/path/to/campp2_brca_2.rda")
load("/path/to/campp2_brca_2_meta.rda")
```

##Run CAMPP2 on example data with default settings:
```
runCampp2(batches=c("tumor_stage","tumor_stage"), prefix="test_CAMPP2", data1=campp2_brca_1, data2=campp2_brca_2, metadata1=campp2_brca_1_meta, metadata2=campp2_brca_2_meta, groups=c("IDs", "diagnosis","IDs", "diagnosis"), technology=c("seq","seq")) 
```

## Mandatory Input and Parameters

**data1**: Gene count matrix (gene IDs as row names and sample IDs as columns). It is recommended to import gene counts using function "import_counts". \

**metadata1**: Samples' metadata table should be imported using function "import_metadata". Metadata must include exactly the same samples as gene counts (data1) and samples must be sorted similarly. \

**technology**: Technology used for the analysis of biological input. Current options are 'array', 'seq', 'ms' or 'other'. This argument is mandatory and depending on which option is chosen, data is transformed differently. If a second dataset is provided, the option should be specified for each dataset, provided as a character vector.\ 

**groups**: Argument defining groups of samples should be specified as a character vector. The first element specifying the name of the column in the metadata file containing sample IDs and the second element specifying the name of the column which contains the groups for the DE/DA analysis.


## Optional arguments
**data2**: Gene count matrix for a second dataset.

**metadata2**: Metadata for a second dataset.

**data.check**: Distributional checks of the input data is activated using logical argument (TRUE/FALSE). If activated, Cullen-Frey graphs will be made for 10 randomly selected variables to check data distributions. This argument is per default set to TRUE.

**batches**: Specifies which metadata should be used for a batch correction (sequencing run/tissue/interstitial fluid/etc.). Argument takes a character vector of length 1 (one dataset) or 2 (two datasets), where the string(s) match a column name(s) in the metadata file(s). Default is NULL.

**kmeans**: Argument for kmeans clustering. The parameter must be specified as a character vector matching the name of a column in the metadata file, denoting the labeling of points on the MDS plot(s). If a parameter is set to "TRUE" (no column name specified) no labels will be added to the plot. Works only for the first dataset (data1). Default is FALSE (do not run).

**plot.heatmap**: Argument for heatmap specified as either: "DE", "DA", "LASSO", "EN" or "Consensus". Defaults is FALSE (do not run).

**correlation**: Argument for correlation analysis. String specify which features should be correlated, options are: "ALL", "DE", "DA", "LASSO", "EN" or "Consensus". For this type of analysis, 2 datasets must include the same samples, e.g. tumor1-normal vs tumor2-normal (3 samples from 1 patient needed). Default is FALSE (do not run).

**survival**: (double check this when parsin survival function) Survival analysis may be performed on differentially expressed/abundant variables, variables from LASSO/EN regression or the consensus of these. Argument "survival" must be specified as either; "DE", "DA", "LASSO", "EN" or "Consensus". The full dataframe of variables may be used (if argument is set to ALL), HOWEVER this is not advisable unless the dataset is small with very few variables. At least, "survival", "outcome", "outcome.time" info must be included in the metadata file. The metadata file must contain at least four columns named; "ids" (sample identifiers), "age" (age in years at diagnosis, surgery or entry into trail), "outcome.time" (time until end of follow-up in weeks, months or years, censuring, death) and "outcome" (numeric 0 = censuring, 1=death). N.B. in case of (paired) normal samples the columns with survival information for these samples should contain "NA" values.

**surv.plot**: Argument which specifies number of features to include per survival plot. Default is 50.

**standardize**: (double check for sequencing) Data centering. This option may be set to "mean" or "median." If two datasets are provided, the standardize option should be specified for each dataset, provided as a character vector. If the argument standardize is not specified and "technology" = "array", then quantile normalization will be performed. Defaults is FALSE (do not run).

**transform**: Data transformation type. Current options are "log2", "log10", "logit" and "voom". If two datasets are provided the parameter should be specified for each dataset, provided as a character vector. Defaults is FALSE (do not run).

**prefix**: Prefix for the results' files and results folder. Defalt is "Results".

**signif**: Cut-offs for log fold change (logFC) and corrected p-value (fdr), defining significant hits (proteins, genes, miRNAs or N-features). If argument is set, it must be a numeric vector, where the first element specifies the cut-off for logFC and the second element specifies the cut-off for corrected p-value (fdr).  In case of 2 datasets, vector must be of length 4. By default, cutoffs will be set to -1 > logFC > 1 and corrected p-values < 0.05.

**plot.mds**: This argument specifies ("TRUE" or "FALSE") if a preliminary MDSplot should be made for data overview. Works only for the first dataset. Default is FALSE (do not run).

**covariates**: Covariates to include in the analysis. If multiple of these, they should be specified as a character vector. The first element in this list must be either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE is specified then covariates will be included in both DE/DA analysis and Survival Analsysis. If FALSE is specified covariates will ONLY be used for Survival Analsysis. Names of covariates should match the desired columns in the metadata file. Default is NULL.

**stratify**: This argument may be used if some of the categorical (NOT continous) covariates violate the cox proportional assumption. The workflow checks for proportional hazard and will retun the covariates that fail the PH test. You may then rerun the workflow with this argument followed by the names of the categorical covariates which failed and these will be stratified. Default is NULL.

**colors**: Custom color pallet for MDS and heatmaps. Must be the same length as number of groups used for comparison (e.g. two groups = two colors) and must be defined as character vector. See R site for avalibe colors http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf. Default is NULL.

**block**: A vector or factor specifying a blocking variable for differential expression analysis. The block must be of same length as the belonging dataset and contain 2 or more options. For 2 datasets the block can be defined as a list of factors or vectors.

**lasso**: Argument specifying parameters for LASSO or Elastic net regression. This argument may be set to 1 for LASSO or >0 & <1 for Elastic Net, but NOT to 0 exactly (Ridge Regression). Defaults is FALSE (do not run).

**WGCNA**: Argument specifying parameter for Weighed Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. It takes a string, either "DA", "DE" or "ALL" specifying if all variables should be included in WGCNA or only differentially expressed / abundant variables. Defaults is FALSE (do not run).

**cutoff.WGCNA**: Argument specifying the cutoff values for WGCNA. The argument takes a numuric vector of three values: (I) minimum modules size, (II) maximum percentage of dissimilarity for merging of modules, and (III) percentage of top most interconnected genes (or other features) to return, from each modules identified in the Weighed Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. Default values are 10,25,25.

**PPint**: Argument specifying that protein-protein interaction networks should be generated using the results of the differential expression analysis. This argument must be a character vector of length two. The first element in this list must be a string specifying the type of gene identifier in the gene counts file provided. Allowed identifiers are: "ensembl_peptide_id", "hgnc_symbol", "ensembl_gene_id", "ensembl_transcript_id", "uniprotswissprot". The second element is a string specifying version of the stringDB to use. Currently only version supported is: 11.0. Default is FALSE (do not run).

**gene.miR.int**: Argument specifying that gene-miRNA interaction networks should be generated using the results of the differential expression analysis. This argument must be a character vector of length two. The first element in this list must be a string specifying the type of miRNA identifier in the gene counts data file. Allowed identifiers are: "mature_mirna_ids", "mature_mirna_accession". The second element must be a string specifying the miRNA-gene database to use, currently options are: "targetscan" (validated miRNAs), "mirtarbase" (predicted miRNAs), "tarscanbase" (validated + predicted miRNAs)". Default is FALSE (do not run).


## FUNCTIONS IN CAMPP2

### ReplaceNAs \
**Description:** \
The features (rows) and samples (columns) with high proportion of "NAs" will be removed based on defined thresholds (70% for rows and 80% for columns by default). Remaining "NA" values will be replaced by imputed values. Missing value imputation is done using llsImpute (1st round). If 1st round was not successful or resulted in negative values, impute.knn algorithm is applied (rows with more than 50% missing values will be imputed using the overall mean per sample). \
**Parameters:** \
data: a dataframe of gene/abundance counts. \
pct.NA.row: a number defining maximal percentage of NA values per row (feature). Rows with a higher percentage of NA values will be removed (70 by default). \
pct.NA.colum:n a number defining maximal percentage of NA values per column (sample). Columns with a higher percentage of NA values will be removed (80 by default). \
**Output from the function:**  \
Data frame with replaced "NA" values \
**An example run:** \
##In each of the 2 datasets, we have 10000 genes. In our example, we will randomly introduce 1000 NAs into each sample. Next, ReplaceNAs function is called. 

```
library(CAMPP2)
``` 

##Test data are already part of the CAMPP2 package so user doesn't need to download them. In case you want to load .rda objects you can alter the path and use this code:
```
load("path/to/campp2_brca_1.rda")
``` 

##get a number of genes in the dataset.
```
n<-nrow(campp2_brca_1)
``` 

##For each sample, 1000 NA values is introduced randomly. All 10000 genes (n) in the example dataset are considered.
```
Na_dataset1<-apply (campp2_brca_1, 2, function(x) {x[sample( c(1:n), floor(n/10))] <- NA; x} )
``` 

##create an object with replaced NAs

```
replacedNAs<-ReplaceNAs(data=Na_dataset1)
```

\


================================================================================================
(THE REST WILL BE CONSIDERED - WE CAN USE SOME INFO TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE ARGUMENTS ABOVE)
**1. Quantitative data (counts) **: An .xlsx (or .txt) file containing feature expression/abundance.
With rows as variables, and columns as samples, e.g. columns
are gene, N-glycan, protein, (mi)RNA identifiers and rows are sample
IDs. The repository https://github.com/ELELAB/N-glycan-TIF/
tree/master/Data/DataExamples contains an example with N-glycans
named: glycandata.xlsx. If two datasets are provided (for correlation
and/or network analysis), this option should be specified as a
comma separated list (without quotes or parenthesis!) of length two,
first entry being data file 1 and second entry data file 2.
&nbsp;

**2. Data type (data_type)**: The user must specify what type of data is provided
in order for the pipeline to pick the appropriate normalization
and/or transformation. Options include; array (mircoarray data),
seq (high throughput sequencing data), ms (mass spectrometry data)
or other (other type). If two datasets are provided (for correlation
and/or network analysis), this option should be specified as a comma
separated list (without quotes or parenthesis!) of length two, first
entry referring to data file 1 and second entry referring to the data
file 2.

• Sequencing data: (data type is set to seq): Variables with low counts
over all groups (tissue, treatment) are filered out, library sizes
are scaled (normalization method is weighted trimmed mean of
M-values, TMM) and data are voom transformed.
• Microarray data (data type is set to array): Data are log transformed
and either quantile normalized (normalizeBetweenArrays) or
standardized using mean or median (specify option -z).
• Mass spectrometry data (data type is set to ms): IF option -t is specified,
then data will be log transformed (log2, log or logit as specified).
It should be noted that CAMPP does NOT perform within-array normalization
(normalizeBetweenArrays), which is standard for two color
intensity data, e.g. this must be done before hand (see limma manual for
more information [26]).

**3 Metadata (metadata)**: An .xlsx file (or .txt) containing metadata. This file
must contain at least two columns, one with identifiers matching
the column names in the data file and one with groups to contrast
in analysis e.g. diagnosis (tumor or normal), tumor stage (1,2 or
3), drug treatment (A, B C) etc. If two datasets are provided (for
correlation and/or network analysis), this option should be specified
as a comma separated list (without quotes or parenthesis!) of
length two, first entry being metadata file 1 and second entry metadata
file 2. The repository https://github.com/ELELAB/N-glycan-TIF/
tree/master/Data/DataExamples contains an example with N-glycans
named: glycanmetadata.xlsx.

**4 Ids and Groups (IDs, groups)**: The user must specify which columns in
the metadata file corresponds to the sample ids and groups for
comparison, receptively. This is done by providing a list of two
strings separated by a comma (without quotes or parenthesis!) ,
indicating the names of the columns which should be used. If two
datasets are provided, and both datasets are to be corrected for
experimental batch, this option should be specified as a comma
separated list (without quotes or parenthesis!) of length four.
The first two entries in the list specifying names of columns
(IDs and groups) to use from metadataset 1 and third and fourth
entry specifying names of columns (ids and groups) to use from
metadataset 2.

## Other Arguments
\
**Multidimensional* Scaling plot** (MDS): The MDS may be set
to generate a preliminary multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot.
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) reduces high-dimensional data
to two (or more) "observable" dimensions (M1 and M2) in such
a way that the inter-sample distance relationship in the simplified
dimensions mimic the distance relationship between the original
values of samples in n-dimensional space (n = number of variables).
MDS was performed with the euclidean distances as the distance
metric. A MDS plot may help to determine whether there appears
to be any "grouping" of data in a desired way (tumor samples
together and normal samples together) or in an undesired way
(experimental batches) before performing the DE/DA analysis.
\

**Data Transformation** (transform): The flag -t may be set if the user
desires the expression/abundance data to be transformed before
analysis. A logarithmic transformation is recommended as the
variance of measurements, from most platforms, depend on the
expression/abundance level itself. The log-transformation reduces
this dependency and additionally pushes the negative binomial
distribution, displayed by count data (miRNA, mRNA), towards
a normal distribution. The user may choose between log2, log10,
logit or voom tranformation. For RNA-seq the voom transformation
is recommended [26], while a log transformation may be
more appropriate for proteomics and N-glycan abundances. If
another sample paired dataset of expression values are provided,
this option should be specified as a comma separated list (without
quotes or parenthesis!) of length two, first entry referring to data
file 1 and second entry referring to the data file 2.


**Batch** (batch): If the data comes from experimental batches and the
user wants to correct for this, a column specifying which batch
each sample belongs, should also be included in the metadata file.
The argument "batch" takes a string (no quotes!) referring to the name
of the column in the metadata file denoting batches (e.g. A, B,
C, or batch1, batch2, batch3, etc.). Batch type must be noted
as a character, meaning **numbers alone are not allowed**. If two
datasets are provided, this option should be specified as a comma
separated list (without quotes or parenthesis!) of length two, first
entry matching the name of a column in metadata file 1 and the
second entry matching the of a column in metadataset 2.


**Distibutional Checks** (check_distr): this argument may be set to FALSE to
remove the default check of variable distributions. If the argument is
not specified (or set to TRUE), the pipeline will produce plots including
histograms, quantile-quantile plots and probability plots.
By default 10 random variables are picked from the dataframe
for plotting (here we are assuming that most variables in an gene
expression matrix or protein abundance matrix will belong to the
same family of distributions.) We heavily recommend always
running the data checks and to NOT ignore the output, as
this vital to whether or not results are reliable!.


**Colors** (colors): An argument to change group color scheme. Accepted Rcolors
must be specified in a comma separated list (without parenthesis!)
of a length matching the number of groups.


**Covariates** (covars): The user may specify argument "covars" if covariates should
be included in the differential expression/abundance analysis
and/or the survival analysis. This argument takes a comma separated
list (without quotes or parenthesis!). The first element in
this list must be either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE is specified
then covariates will be included in both DE/DA analysis and Survival
Analsysis. If FALSE is specified covariates will ONLY be
used for Survival Analsysis. All other elements of the list after
element one (TRUE/FALSE) must be strings matching one or
more column names in the metadata file. Age is automatically
added as a covariate for survival anlysis and should therefore not
be specified with "covars"!


**LogFC and FDR** (logFC_FDR): Cut-offs for log2 fold change and corrected
p-value (fdr). Defaults are logFC > 1 or logFC < -1 and fdr
< 0.05. This argument takes a comma separated list of length two
(without quotes or parenthesis!). The first element specifying
cut-off for logFC and the second element specifying cut-off for
FDR. If two datasets are provided, the list must have length four,
e.g. cut-offs for both sets.

**Kmeans Clustering** (KMeansClust): The argument "KMeansClust" is set 
to specify K-means
clustering. This argument takes a string specifying which column
in the metadata file should be used to label the samples in the
returned plot(s). If KMeansClust is set but left empty, no labels are added
to the plot(s). The number of clusters tested will be based on
number of samples, fewer samples will result in fewer kmeans
tested. A folder with MDS plots will be returned for the best n
number of kmeans, based on the bayesian information criterion
(BIC) [30]. If the dataset has many variables i.e. RNAseq with
many genes, multiple samples of 3000 variables will be generated
and tested to overcome issues with computational time and the
consensus of best n kmeans will be returned.
Clustering may only be performed one dataset at a time!

**LASSO/Elastic-Net Regression** (LA_EN): The argument "LA_EN" may be set to
specify least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LA_EN 1.0) or
Elastic-Net (0.0 < LA_EN < 1.0) regression. LASSO/EN is performed
using the R-package glmnet [12]. K-fold (default is 10) cross
validation (cv.glmnet) is used to estimate the optimal value for the
hyperparameter, lambda. LASSO/EN may be performed in two
ways, (I) the dataset is split into training and testing subsets, k-fold
cross validation is performed on the training dataset, followed by
estimation of specificity and sensitivity (area under the curve =
AUC) using the test dataset, or (Il) k-fold cross validation is performed
using the full dataset, no AUC is reported. CAMPP will
automatically estimate whether the input dataset is large enough
to split into training and test subsets and whether EN/LASSO
is advisable to perform altogether. Specifying the argument LA_EN will
produce a list of variables selected by LASSO and a file with the
overlap between differential expression/abundance analysis and
LASSO regression. LASSO is run with n (default is 10) different
random seeds and the consensus set of variables is returned.
N.B LASSO it not appropriate for heavily unbalanced group
designs! When running LASSO a bar-plot with cross-validation
errors are returned, as well as an area under the curve (AUC),
IF the dataset is large and balanced enough to split into test and
training set. LASSO may only be performed on one dataset at a
time!

N.B It is important to note setting the argument LA_EN is a trade-off between
retaining information in the regression model without merely including
all (or almost all) variables (this happens if LA_EN is very low). As the
point of elastic-net regression is to aid the user in picking a smaller set
of markers for validation from a potentially large set of differentially expressed/
abundant variables, we suggest to set LA_EN to between 0.5-0.9,


**Weighed Gene Co-expression Network Analysis** (WGCNA): The
argument "WGCNA" must be set (DA, DE or ALL) in order to perform Weighed
Gene Co-expression Network Analysis with the R-package WGCNA
[23]. WGCNA, despite its name, is in this case not exclusive to
gene expression data but may be applied to any quantitative expression
data. Minimum module size is 10 variables and modules
with less than 25% dissimilarity will be merged (default values).
The cutoff for top most interconnected variables (genes, proteins
ect.) in an identified module is set to the 75th quantile by default.
The user may specify different cutoffs for minimum module size,
module dissimilarity merging and and % of interconnected variables
to report with the flag -x.

**how to solve flag -x?**
N.B the softpower plot generated by a WGCNA run should
be inspected before interpretation of results. If the data is very
heterogeneous, or if there are too few variables or samples (minimum
15 samples for WGCNA) the scale-free topology fit index
(printed to the screen while running) might fail to reach values
above 0.8 for reasonable powers (see point 5 in WGCNA tutorial:
https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/
Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html). If this is the case, the dataset may not
be appropriate forWGCNA.
WGCNA may only be performed with one dataset at a time!



**Correlation Analysis** (correlation): The argument "correlation" must 
be set to perform
correlation analysis between two matched datasets. For option
"correlation" the user must provide a string specifying which subset of variables
should be included in the correlation analysis; "ALL" = all
variables (not advisable, unless dataset is small), "DA" / "DE" =
Differentially Expressed/Abundant, "LASSO" / "EN" = LASSO
/ Elastic Net results or "Consensus" = Overlap between DE and
LASSO/EN. Naturally two datasets for must be input in order
to perform correlation analysis. Both datasets are given to the
argument correlation, with the names of the files separated by a comma
(no quotes or parenthesis!). The two dataset do not need to have
the same dimensions, but there must be at least a partial overlap
in both variables and samples (column names). Column names of
these datasets should match the IDs in the ids column in the two
metadata files.



**Survival Analysis** (survival): The argument "survival" must be set in order 
to perform
survival analysis using cox proportional hazard model. Options
for survival analysis are; "ALL" (not advisable!), "DA" /
"DE" = Differentially Expressed/Abundant, "LASSO" / "EN" =
LASSO / Elastic Net results or "Consensus" = Overlap between
DE and LASSO/EN, referring to the set of variables used for
cox-regression. For survival analysis the metadata file must contain
at least three columns in addition to the sample IDs named;
’outcome.time’ (time until end of follow-up, censuring or death
in weeks, months or years), ’outcome’ (numeric 0 = censuring,
1=dead) and ’survival’ (numeric 0 = no survival info, 1=survival
info available). If the user wishes to correct for potential confounders
(e.g. patient age, tumor grade, hormone levels, drug treatment
ect.) these should also be included in the metadata.xlsx.
CAMPP checks two underlying assumptions of the cox model
before performing survival analysis (I) a linear relationship of continuous
covariates with log hazards and (II) proportional hazards
of categorical and continuous covariates, e.i. constant relative
hazard. If the requirement of linearity is not fulfilled, cubic splines
will be added to the covariate(s) in question.



**P-P Interactions** (PPI): The argument PPI may be specified to perform
protein-protein interaction network analysis. Input for this argument
is a comma separated list of length two (without quotes
or parenthesis!), where the first element specifies the type of
gene IDs in the data file, accepted IDs are: uniprotswissprot, ensembl_
peptide_id, hgnc_symbol, ensembl_gene_id or ensembl_
transcript_id. The second element specifies the protein-protein
interaction database to use, currently the only supported database
is STRING [20], accepted inputs are: stringdatabase.



**Gene-miRNA Interactions** (miR_G_I): The argument miR_G_I may be specified to
perform gene-miRNA interaction network analysis. Input for
this argument is a comma separated list of length two (without
quotes or parenthesis!), where the first element specifies the type of
miRNA IDs in the data file, accepted IDs are: mature_mirna_ids
or mature_mirna_accession. The second element specifies the
Gene-miRNA interaction database to use (validated, predicted or
both), accepted inputs are: targetscan, mirtarbase or tarscanbase.
N.B: If both -p and -i are set, CAMPP will integrate P-P and
Gene-miR networks. Naturally two data files must be provided
to use both PPI and miR_G_I, it is assumed that data file 1 contains genes
and data file 2 contains miRNAs!



The next page contains an elaborate table (Figure 1) which goes
through most of the plots generated by the CAMPP pipeline. In this
table the user may find information about in which type of analysis
the plot is produced, what it shows and how to interpret it.

# N-glycan Serum Markers for BC Diagnostics


This section contains an example of how CAMPP is run using different
flags in the command-line and what output the user can expect. The
files used for running this example may be found in the repository https:
//github.com/ELELAB/N-glycan-TIF/tree/master/Data/DataExamples.

The case below uses N-glycans abundances measured using high
resolution quantitative Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(UPLC) [28] from interstitial samples [15] and matched serum. Tumor
interstitial fluid (TIF), normal interstitial fluid (NIF) and serum samples
were collected from 90 women diagnosed with breast cancer
(BC). A total of 165 N-glycan groups were identified [32].

Briefly, the involvement of N-glycosylation in development and progression
of BC has been documented by both in vitro and in vivo
studies [3, 5, 16]. Several circulating N-glycan patterns with altered
glycan structures, possibly originating from a primary tumor or from
other organs, in response to a neoplastic process, have recently been
described in a number of studies by using high-throughput N-glycan
profiling [2, 18, 25, 28].


## Data Normalization, Transformation and Distributional Checks

If an input dataset contains missing values CAMPP will automatically
impute these, unless missing per column > 70%. Depending on which
data input is given CAMPP will perform data normalization and transformation
(argument "data_type", see section on mandatory
input). 

The quantitative N-glycan data (used in this example) are
relative (fractional) meaning that the sum of all values within one
sample yields 100. Abundances of N-glycans were quantified using
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The
dataset had already been standardized by the MS-software, therefore
the argument "data_type" was set to ms and the argument transform was set to 
log2. As the N-glycan data were quantified over three LC-MS/MS runs, the
argument batch should be set, e.g. data will be corrected for experimental batch.
Before performing any analysis it is advisable to evaluate the distribution
of the normalized data. CAMPP automatically generates distributional
plots for n (default is 10) randomly selecting input variables for
the user to evaluate - to skip this step the argument check_distr may be set to
FALSE).
