Description: The CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline2 (CAMPP2) is a simple
  bioinformatics tool intended to automatize identification of potential
  diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers. The pipeline is versatile
  and may be used for analysis of a variety of quantitative biological
  data from high throughput platforms, including genes, proteins, small
  RNAs, lipids and glycans. CAMPP2 currently supports:
  replacing missing values, data normalization, batch correction, 
  distributional check, dimensionality reduction, clustering, 
  differential expression/abundance analysis, LASSO/Elastic Net regression,
  random forest, and visualisations
